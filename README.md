# Traffic-Simulation

Project is aimed to simulate interactions between vehicles on the streets and to observe emerging behaviour of such multi-agent systems. Images below show a bus line in the town (left) and agents going along the way (right). I compared average velocities of buses with two types of bus stops (in-lane and bus bay).

Implementation is in Python, visualisation with Bokeh Library. Developed by: Y. Ismail, K. Korolev, L. Nijim.
Inspired by initial work of Y. Kuo, A. Mahanta, A. Indreswaran.
